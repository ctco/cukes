    And response does not contain property "gadgets.find{gadget->gadget.id==1858}.updatedDate"

  Scenario: Check attributes of a single Gadget record (request by ID)

    And response equals to "Object not found in the database"

  Scenario: Should get wrong expectation
    And should wait at most 30 seconds with interval 1 seconds until property "type" equal to "SMART_WATCH"
